Self keyword
But before talking about the self keyword (which is actually not a python keyword
or any special literal), first, letâ€™s recall what are class variables and instance
variables. Class variables are variables that are being shared with all instances
(objects) which were created using that particular class. So when accessed a class
variable from any instance, the value will be the same. Instance variables, on the
other hand, are variables which all instances keep for themselves (i.e a particular
object owns its instance variables).
So typically values of instance variables differ from instance to instance.
